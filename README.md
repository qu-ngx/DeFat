> NuFit is an application developed by a group of four students from the Google Developer Student Club - DePauw University Chapter. Our app aims to create nutritious and healthy meal plans for anyone who is on a diet by using AI Camera technology to inform on different types of food, helping organize their healthy meals, and providing information through fun quizzes.

## Our user survey

+ The survey shows that 87.3% of all the surveyed groups like and think that our ideas are applicable as a solution to the problems we are challenging ourselves to. At the same time, 75.5% of the surveyed users found that our application is practical to our goals and that we could solve our UN Problems.
